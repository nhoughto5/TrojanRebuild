    <h4>The Processor Trojan System</h4>
    <p>The need for cyber security continues to increase as the global technological interconnection grows. Hardware trojans are a malicious 
        modification of the circuitry of an integrated circuit. In a diverse global economy, outsourcing of production tasks is a common way to lower a product's cost. 
        Embedded hardware devices are not always produced by the firms that design and/or sell them, nor in the same country where they will be used. 
        Outsourced manufacturing can raise doubt about the evidence for the integrity of the manufactured product (i.e., one's certainty that the end-product has no design modifications compared to its original design). 
        Anyone with access to the manufacturing process could, in theory, introduce some change to the final product. For complex products, small changes with large effects can be difficult to detect.
        The uvic's hardware trojan system provides means of analyzing these attacks by characterization based on physical representation, activation phase or action phase.
